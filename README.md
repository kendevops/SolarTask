# Financial Dashboard Application

### Project Overview

The task is to build a financial dashboard application with multiple views for the
user with responsive design and functionality. The main purpose of this application is to display
an overview of financial activities, card details, transactions, statistics, and user settings.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node installed in your system.

clone the repo 
```
https://github.com/kendevops/SolarTask
```
Navigate to the project directory, install dependencies and start the application
```bash
  cd solarTask

  npm install

  npm run dev
```
- You can access the deployed version by going to [solar-task](https://solar-task.vercel.app/)



## Assumptions made during Dev

The following assumptions where made while developing the application.

- I noticed that the background of the `Overview` and that of `Settings` page is not the same on mobile as mobile on Overview is all white and the setting page had gray. I made it all white for both pages for consistency.

- Made use of React Icons for the icons usage all through the application as the right icon package used wasn't shared.

- Built the functionality for toggling the sidebar on mobile and tablet view.

- Made sure the application is fully optimized with lazy loading and react memo where necessary.

- Deployed to vercel by few clicks in connection with my Github account.
